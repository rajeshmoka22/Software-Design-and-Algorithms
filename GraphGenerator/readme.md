Graph Generator:
- To add the graph(connected graph - check the sample graph 'graph.png' in the project)
  - Go to the graphGenerator.js file and define the following:
    - pass the no of vertices to the graph.
    - add edges using the addEdge method which accepts vertice1, vertice2, distance between two vertices.

- To calculate the shortest path:
  - use the getShortestPath method from the graphGenerator.js and pass the graphInstance, startPoint and endPoint.

- Run 'npm start' to run the application after providing the above data, Check the console for the shortest path.


Connected graph - means that every vertice has connected to atleast one vertice.
